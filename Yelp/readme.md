#### Overview

chewsit is your opportunity to really loosen your belt! You will be able to find a new exciting local restaurant, provided by Yelp data, and it is up designed to be easy and fun to use. chewsit enables users to discover great local businesses using a game of this or that. The big idea is  of chewsit is to create food away if you dont like it and swipe food towards you if you want to eat it, you can even get a ride to the restaurant using Uber and share the location with your friends. 

Here are some of the things chewsit does for you:

- Employs gamification to find the best local business (tacos/Italian/bars/etc.)
- Delivers recommendations for the best restuarants near you
- Get a ride to the restaurant in style with Uber or select the address to have Google Maps help you navigate
- Delivers Yelp recommendations through a push notification messaging experience

Over the course of the last three weeks we have operated our team using agile methodologies in a Scrum fashion. Each week of the project was one sprint and we had a stand-up and grooming every day to track progress of our deliverables using Trello as our agile board. Each item of development work was assigned a point value that directly correlated to the amount of effort the person who was working on the task felt was adequate. **We had stuctured code reviews and no one was allowed to merge their own pull request or even make a pull request of their own code!**

- 1 point was a few hours at most
- 2 points was a day or less
- 3 point was at least a day
- 5 points was at least two days
- 8 points was at least three days
- 13 points was the entirety of the sprint (no 13 point tickets were allowed)

#### What did we do?

We have a working project that:

- Calls the Yelp API, which provides access to a large subset of Yelp’s content in JSON format, including a review snippet, review or business thumbnail, business name, address, phone number, star rating, number of reviews, and much more	
- Allows the user to quickly view businesses and, as a result, opportunities for discovery, through a richly visual and geographically-relevant presentation	
- Adheres to Yelp’s [Display Requirements](https://www.yelp.com/developers/display_requirements) and [Terms of Use](https://www.yelp.com/developers/api_terms)	
- Provides a new, interesting twist by creating a mashup of multiple apps in a Tinder + Yelp fashion
- Includes **at least 2 prototypes**
- Includes user stories based on your research and feature prioritization in a Trello board for the **complete flow of our app**
- Allows the sharing of content via social media and messaging apps
- Looks great in both landscape and portrait modes and reflects Material Design principles
- Includes at least one **Notification** feature
- Includes manual test cases that cover our app.
- Uses **Job Scheduler**
- Does not crash or hang and handles for when networking/internet is slow or unavailable
- Has code that is semantically clean and well-organized


**Bonus:**

- Integrates with mapping and/or navigation
- Integrates with messaging/communication apps
- Allows the user to ‘like’ a new discovery from within the app (for clarity: this did not mean creating or posting content on Yelp via the API, but rather standalone functionality built into your app)
